# Sydney Restaurant Analysis and Rating Prediction

## Assignment 1: Predictive Modelling of Eating-Out Problem

This repository contains code and data for the "Sydney Restaurant Analysis and Rating Prediction" project. This project focuses on exploring and analyzing restaurant data in Sydney, including geographical distribution, cuisine types, and cost, and building predictive models to predict restaurant ratings.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: In this part, the restaurant data is explored, missing values are handled, feature engineering is performed, and the data is prepared for modeling.

2. Predictive Modeling: Predictive models are built and evaluated to predict restaurant ratings. Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-Neighbors Classifier are employed.

## Data Exploration

The project starts by importing and understanding the restaurant data. The following steps are executed:
- Import necessary libraries.
- Explore the contents of the data directory.
- Load the dataset.
- Analyze the dataset's shape, information, and statistics.
- Check for missing values and handle duplicates.
- Extract and analyze cuisine types and suburb information.
- Visualize the data through various plots.

## Interactive Maps

Interactive maps using Plotly and Geopandas are created to visualize the density of restaurants serving specific cuisines in Sydney.


## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes:
- Handling missing values in both categorical and numerical columns.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Performing feature scaling on numerical features.

## Predictive Modeling

- For regression, Linear Regression and Gradient Descent Regression are used.
- For classification, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-Neighbors Classifier are applied.
- Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R^2) scores.

## Model Evaluation

Model performance is assessed, and results are visualized using confusion matrices and scatter plots.
